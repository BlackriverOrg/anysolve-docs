## Creating Your Account

To dive into the world of AnySolve's automation, begin by making an account using your email. It's an easy process. Once you land on the homepage, you'll be prompted to sign up in order to access our main feature – the AI tools. Once you've signed up, your account is ready, and you can start using our services. After creating your account, you'll notice an icon in the top right corner. Just click on it to access your dashboard, where you can access your settings.

## Navigating the Dashboard

Once your account is set up, you can easily access your user dashboard. Just click on your account's icon located in the top right corner, and then select "Settings." Within the settings, you'll find several sections:

1. **Billing**: This is where you'll find your credit balance, which indicates the available credits you can use for running tools. If you need more credits, you'll see the option to "Buy New Credits with Stripe." Clicking this button allows you to purchase additional credits. We accept various payment methods, and you'll find the details here.

2. **Personal Access Token**: This section is for managing your personal access tokens.

3. **Secrets**: Here, you can manage your stored secrets.

## Exploring Available Tools

This is where the true AI magic unfolds. As you land on the homepage, you'll spot the "Discover Tools" button at the top. A simple click here opens the door to a wealth of existing tools, spanning from simple to more intricate ones. Following the previous step, you'll find yourself on the "All Tools" page – a hub of possibilities. The tools are neatly arranged by popularity, meaning the frequently used tools take the lead, followed by less common ones. Keep an eye on the first two rows; they showcase the newest additions.

If you're looking for more, just scroll down and click "Load More Tools" to unveil additional options that may not be visible on the current page. The tool library is thoughtfully curated, featuring a wide array of AI tools tailored to various needs. These tools cater to writers, journalists, data scientists, marketers, software developers, and even general users – meaning there's something for everyone.

## Creating Custom Tools

AnySolve goes beyond just offering existing tools – you have the power to craft your very own. This feature is all about customization, ensuring our platform caters to diverse users like yourself. We've made it possible for you to create tools tailored to your needs.

On the **"All Tools"** page, keep an eye out for the **"Create New Tool"** button. This serves as your entrance into the tool editor.

**The Tool Editor**: Don't worry if you're not a coding expert. Our tool editor is designed to be user-friendly, even for those with limited coding knowledge. On the left side of the editor, you'll find subtools organized into different categories. For instance, under "Large Language Model," you'll find subtools utilizing GPT models. Likewise, the "Memory" category houses subtools with memory-related features. For instance, the "Memory (Document)" subtool lets you store a document in memory for repeated use.

Begin by creating simple tools that utilize the GPT model. To start, select the "**Chat Complete (GPT and others)**" subtool. After this selection, the initial step is to input tool details: title, short description, detailed description, and relevant tags. Scroll down, and you'll encounter the "Chat Complete (GPT and others)" section you previously chose.

Your first tool is defining the input prompt in the "**Input: Prompt (Text)**" section. This prompt guides the GPT model. Following this, complete the name, description, and example fields for both input and output.

At the bottom of the tool editor page, you'll find the option to "**Run Tool to Generate Output Examples.**" Clicking this leads you to the "**Publish a New Tool**" button. Upon clicking this button, your tool becomes ready for use in the tool library. It's important to note that you can refine this tool later by creating improved versions. If you miss something in the first version, don't worry – you can address it in subsequent versions.

## Executing Tools

Performing tools is a smooth and straightforward experience, all thanks to AnySolve's user-friendly features. When you access a tool, you'll be presented with its dedicated window. Each tool has its own page, featuring input fields and a "**Run Tool**" button. The specific input fields can vary from one tool to another. While some tools may require a single input, others might need multiple inputs for successful execution.

As you input the required information, it's essential to carefully read and understand the field instructions. This ensures that you provide accurate information and avoid any errors. Once you've completed inputting the necessary details, you're ready to click the "**Run Tool**" button. The model will take some time to process and will then generate the desired output.

## Handling Tool Results

At AnySolve, AI is employed to customize tool outcomes according to your needs. Once you click the "**Run Tool**" button, the output will become visible. The format of the output varies based on the tool type. For instance, certain tools may generate not only text but also PDFs, images, and other usable files.

Should you find the output quality lacking, you have the flexibility to make improvements through multiple attempts. In certain advanced tools, there's an additional memory feature. This enables you to save the document you've generated, allowing you to reuse it later to further enhance its quality.
