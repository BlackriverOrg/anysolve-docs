## Why are new versions of tasks created / Why can't I edit a version?

Whenever a task is edited a new version of the task is created. Old version can not be edited afterwards. The idea behind this version system is that users can rely on the stability of a version of a task. It never gets changed as long as the underlying API or base implementation does not change.
